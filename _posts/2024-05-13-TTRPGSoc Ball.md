title: "Planning & Running the TTRPGSoc Ball"
---
### Introduction

The amount of planning that went into the TTRPGSoc (and friends) ball is beyond what you might have expected. If you just showed up and had a good time on the night then I'm happy to hear it, but behind the scenes there were many emails sent.


Hello all, hope that you all had a good time at the ball if you managed to secure tickets. I was most impressed by the speed at which they sold out. Our first release tickets were gone in around 3 days but our second release sold out in a mere 4 hours.

### Chapter 1: *Can* we run a ball?

Which is a good question, right? TTRPGSoc is a small society in the grand scheme of things, and many of the societies which run an end of year ball are at *least* twice the size of ours. Early in semester 1 of the 2023-2024 school year we had come up with some vague ideas for the 

## The Team
Initially the plan was just to have a ball of our own, but limiting the attendance to only those in TTRPGSoc really limits the number of people that are interested in coming. The majority of other societies which host their own ball often have members in the several hundreds, and a society bank account to match. If we wanted to feasibly run this event without going stupendously into debt, we would need some help. Luckily, our very own treasurer (Brian), has a handful of friends on the committees of some clubs which we expected to have a decent interest overlap with our own TTRPGSoc.

After some correspondence, we were able to setup a meeting with committee members from TTRPGSoc, Escape Room Society, Wargaming Society & Board Games society, and I gave a general pitch with some *very* last minute slides I had thrown together the night before at 2 in the morning. I've not really presented anything in "meeting" form before, save for my lab interviews for my degree, so I was decently nervous to present an idea which I was really excited to get off the ground. After all, at the time it was unlikely that we would have been able to do it and get nearly as good of a turnout without the help from the other societies.

Of course, sometime later in planning we were also able to reach out to and invite UOMC to join us, totalling us to the 5 societies we ran with until the end.

## Writing

## The Characters

In the very first meeting, consisting of myself, Hannah (Events officer, previous chair) and Gable (friend, next chair), we set out to write as many funny character ideas for the ball in five minutes exactly, the result was as follows (FIG. 1).

Once we had a big list of character we decided to try and pick the 25 funniest ones, taking into account the different dynamics that some characters might have as pairs, such as **The Astrologer**, and **The Astronomer**. In the end we came to the following list

- The Antiquarian
- The Army Sergeant
- The Astrologer
- The Astronomer
- The Changeling
- The Chef
- The Cultist
- The Gardener
- The Ghost
- The Influencer
- The Inventor
- The Investor
- The Janitor
- *The Jester*
- The Lady of the House
- The Lawyer
- The Pirate Queen
- The Pizza Delivery Person
- ~~The Policeman~~
- ~~The Politician (A)~~
- ~~The Politician (B)~~
- The Priest
- The Professor
- The Rat King
- The Rockstar
- The Roman Centurion
- The Scallywag
- The Sheriff
- The Time Traveller
- The Vampire
- The Victorian Orphan

Naturally, we decided to cut The ~~Pig~~ Policeman for being a little distasteful for a night that was intended to be fore fun, especially with some of the current ongoings on university campus. Additionally, we had thought we wanted 2 politicians of different political party's as two of the characters, and in the middle of the evening were going to hold a political vote for something. The political views of the politicians themselves weren't exactly "spicy" either, as the initial ideas were to have each of them campaigning to remove a different day from the week, being part of the "No Thursday Party" or "Anti Tuesday Party", but ultimately we still decided to cut them for being distasteful.

### Fundraising

Unfortunately, we were only able to run the singular, karaoke social. We're super glad for everyone that came along, as we had no real idea how it was going to go. We also weren't really sure how much money we were supposed to be earning. The amount of money that we could get our hands on really would determine "how big" we could go in the booking.

The initial plan, however, was to run a whole multitude of different socials between all of the different societies that were collaborating on the project. Some of the ones we had planned were:
- Puzzle pub crawl
- Pub quiz
- Sip & paint miniatures (at Manchester Museum)
- Come as your character (as inspired by the 2023 social)
### Budget

From the beginning of planning, the goal for the event has not been to draw in a profit, but to break even. From the very first meeting I had been hammering home this idea that any potential profit would be split exactly 5 ways, and any outstanding additional costs would be covered by TTRPGSoc and the Fundit payment of £400 we received midway through the planning period.

In the end, the major spending and earners were as follows:

Budget Breakdown:

| Item                               | Earning (£) |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Actor Tickets (30 @ £7pp)          | 210         |
| First Release Tickets (24 @ £12pp) | 288         |
| Second Release (24 @ £15pp)        | 360         |
| Fundit (Student Union)             | 400         |
| Karaoke Fundraiser (20 @ £4pp)     | 80          |
| Total Budget                       | 1338        |

Spending Breakdown

| Item                     | Cost (£) |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Catering (78 @ £~10.6pp) | 828      |
| Photographer             | 60       |
| Bartenders (2 @ £13hr)   | 104      |
| Security                 | 80       |
| Lighting Technician      | 117      |
| Sound Technician         | 117      |
| Reprographics            | 28       |
| Props & Decorations      | 48       |
| Total Cost               | 1382     |

title: "Planning & Running the TTRPGSoc Ball"

# Introduction

The amount of planning that went into the TTRPGSoc (and friends) ball is beyond what you might have expected. If you just showed up and had a good time on the night then I'm happy to hear it, but behind the scenes there were many emails sent.


Hello all, hope that you all had a good time at the ball if you managed to secure tickets. I was most impressed by the speed at which they sold out. Our first release tickets were gone in around 3 days but our second release sold out in a mere 4 hours.

# Chapter 1: *Can* we run a ball?

Which is a good question, right? TTRPGSoc is a small society in the grand scheme of things, and many of the societies which run an end of year ball are at *least* twice the size of ours.

## The Team
Initially the plan was just to have a ball of our own, but limiting the attendance to only those in TTRPGSoc really limits the number of people that are interested in coming. The majority of other societies which host their own ball often have members in the several hundreds, and a society bank account to match. If we wanted to feasibly run this event without going stupendously into debt, we would need some help. Luckily, our very own treasurer (Brian), has a handful of friends on the committees of some clubs which we expected to have a decent interest overlap with our own TTRPGSoc.

After some correspondence, we were able to setup a meeting with committee members from TTRPGSoc, Escape Room Society, Wargaming Society & Board Games society, and I gave a general pitch with some *very* last minute slides I had thrown together the night before at 2 in the morning. I've not really presented anything in "meeting" form before, save for my lab interviews for my degree, so I was decently nervous to present an idea which I was really excited to get off the ground. After all, at the time it was unlikely that we would have been able to do it and get nearly as good of a turnout without the help from the other societies.

Of course, sometime later in planning we were also able to reach out to and invite UOMC to join us, totalling us to the 5 societies we ran with until the end.

## Finance
From the beginning of planning, the goal for the event has not been to draw in a profit, but to break even. From the very first meeting I had been hammering home this idea that any potential profit would be split exactly 5 ways, and any outstanding additional costs would be covered by TTRPGSoc and the Fundit payment of £400 we received midway through the planning period.

In the end, the major spending and earners were as follows:

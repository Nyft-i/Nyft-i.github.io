As mentioned elsewhere on this website, I am an undergraduate at the University of Manchester. As such, I have produced several works for my degree which I will link below:
# Lab work (Y3)
My third year lab work is a little more competent than the prior years. I am quite proud particularly of the latter

# Masters Project
My semester 1 masters project is titled "Improving Pulsar Timing precision", and can be found here: [pdf](assets/pdf/jsalis_improving_pulsar_timing_precision_i.pdf)

I am currently still working on this project for a second semester and so watch this space if you're interested in pulsar scheduling.

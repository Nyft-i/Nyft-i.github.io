# Me

Hey, my name is Jade Salisbury. I'm an undergraduate Physicist at the University of Manchester, England. In the year 2025 I decided that I would try to 'make more things' and so I have created this blog a my method by which I will this. As for type of content that can be expected here, anything from science to videogames and books. I like to talk a lot so I imagine that will translate quite well to typing a lot also.

# Name 

The website name is an interesting one. For the last couple of years I have really discovered my passion in Physics, which I have found to be pulsar astronomy.
